Feature: Fixed Supply Tokens
  As an account owner
  I want to create a fixed supply token with some key properties of an ERC-20 token,
  So that I can easily create a token coming from an ethereum background without applying too much extra learning

  #Scenario: 1: Creating a fixed supply token

  #Scenario: 2: Creating a conflicting token

  #Scenario: 3: Total supply
