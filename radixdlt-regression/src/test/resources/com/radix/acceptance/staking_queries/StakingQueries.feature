Feature: Staking Queries
  As a Java developer for the Radix network,
  I would like to be able to query staked amounts and status for an account I specify,
  So that I can keep track of staking and staking status.

  Scenario: 1: Validator without stakes
    Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    And I have registered validator with allowed delegator1
    When I request validator stake balance
    Then I can observe that validator has amount of tokens staked equal to zero

  Scenario: 2: Staking by one delegator
    Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    And I have registered validator with allowed delegator1
    And I stake some tokens by delegator1
    When I request validator stake balance
    Then I can observe that validator has amount of tokens staked equal to amount staked by delegator

  Scenario: 3: Full unstaking by delegator
    Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    And I have registered validator with allowed delegator1
    And I stake some tokens by delegator1
    And I unstake full amount by delegator1
    When I request validator stake balance
    Then I can observe that validator has amount of tokens staked equal to zero

  Scenario: 4: Partial unstaking by delegator
    Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    And I have registered validator with allowed delegator1
    And I stake some tokens by delegator1
    And I unstake partial amount by delegator1
    When I request validator stake balance
    Then I can observe that validator has amount of tokens staked equal to initial amount minus unstaked amount

  Scenario: 5: Staking by different delegators
    Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    And I have registered validator with allowed delegator1 and delegator2
    And I stake some tokens by delegator1
    And I stake some tokens by delegator2
    When I request validator stake balance
    Then I can observe that validator has amount of tokens staked equal to sum of stakes by delegator1 and delegator2

  Scenario: 6: Stake by not configured delegator
    Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    And I have registered validator with allowed delegator1
    When I try to stake some tokens by delegator2
    Then I can observe that staking is not allowed
