Feature: Mutable Supply Tokens
  As an account owner
  I want to create a mutable supply token in my account with some key properties of an ERC-20 token
  So that I can easily create a token coming from an ethereum background without applying too much extra learning

  #Scenario: 1: Creating a unique token
    #Given I have access to a suitable Radix network
    #When I submit a mutable-supply token-creation request with name "RLAU Test", symbol "RLAU", initialSupply 1000000000 and granularity 1
    #Then I can observe the atom being accepted

  #Scenario: 2: Creating a conflicting token

  #Scenario: 3: Transacting

  #Scenario: 4: Minting

  #Scenario: 5: Burning

  #Scenario: 6: Initial supply
