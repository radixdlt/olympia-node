  title: Radix Core API
  description: |
    This API provides endpoints from a node for integration with the Radix ledger.

    # Overview

    > WARNING
    >
    > The Core API is __NOT__ intended to be available on the public web. It is
    > designed to be accessed in a private network.

    The Core API is separated into three:
    * The **Data API** is a read-only api which allows you to view and
    sync to the state of the ledger.
    * The **Construction API** allows you to construct and submit a transaction
    to the network.
    * The **Key API** allows you to use the keys managed by the node to sign transactions.

    The Core API is a low level API primarily designed for network integrations
    such as exchanges, ledger analytics providers, or hosted ledger data dashboards
    where detailed ledger data is required and the integrator can be expected to
    run their node to provide the Core API for their own consumption.

    For a higher level API, see the [Gateway API](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-network-gateway/main/generation/gateway-api-spec.yaml).

    For node monitoring, see the [System API](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/main/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/system/api.yaml).

    ## Rosetta

    The Data API and Construction API is inspired from [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/)
    most notably:
      * Use of a JSON-Based RPC protocol on top of HTTP Post requests
      * Use of Operations, Amounts, and Identifiers as universal language to
      express asset movement for reading and writing

    There are a few notable exceptions to note:
      * Fetching of ledger data is through a Transaction stream rather than a
      Block stream
      * Use of `EntityIdentifier` rather than `AccountIdentifier`
      * Use of `OperationGroup` rather than `related_operations` to express related
      operations
      * Construction endpoints perform coin selection on behalf of the caller.
      This has the unfortunate effect of not being able to support high frequency
      transactions from a single account. This will be addressed in future updates.
      * Construction endpoints are online rather than offline as required by Rosetta

    Future versions of the api will aim towards a fully-compliant Rosetta API.

    ## Enabling Endpoints

    All endpoints are enabled when running a node with the exception of two endpoints, each of
    which need to be manually configured to access:
    * `/transactions` endpoint must be enabled with configuration `api.transaction.enable=true`.
    This is because the transactions endpoint requires additional database storage which may not
    be needed for users who aren't using this endpoint
    * `/key/sign` endpoint must be enable with configuration `api.sign.enable=true`. This is a
    potentially dangerous endpoint if accessible publicly so it must be enabled manually.

    ## Client Code Generation

    We have found success with generating clients against the
    [api.yaml specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/main/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/api.yaml).
    See https://openapi-generator.tech/ for more details.

    The OpenAPI generator only supports openapi version 3.0.0 at present, but you can
    change 3.1.0 to 3.0.0 in the first line of the spec without affecting generation.

    # Data API Flow

    The Data API can be used to synchronize a full or partial view of the ledger,
    transaction by transaction.

    ![Data API Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/data_sequence_flow.png)

    # Construction API Flow

    The Construction API can be used to construct and submit transactions to the network.

    ![Construction API Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/construction_sequence_flow.png)

    Unlike the Rosetta Construction API [specification](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html),
    this Construction API selects UTXOs on behalf of the caller. This has the unfortunate
    side effect of not being able to support high frequency transactions from a single
    account due to UTXO conflicts. This will be addressed in a future release.

      Entities represent something that can hold resource balances and data objects.
      For example, a public key account is an entity which can hold token balances
      on behalf of a private key holder.

      ![Entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/entity.png '#width=500px;')

      An Operation is an update which occurs on an Entity. There are two types of
      Operations:
      * A **Resource** Operation which is a balance change on an Entity
      * A **Data** Operation which is a data object update on an Entity

      ![Operation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/operation.png '#width=500px;')

      ## State Identifiers
      The Radix network has no concept of blocks. Instead transactions are
      managed in a flat ordered list. A hash chain is formed from these transactions
      called a Transaction Accumulator. A Transaction Accumulator represents a point
      in time of the ledger with a valid state.

      ![State Identifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/state_identifiers.png '#width=500px;')

      The transaction accumulator along with the index forms a State Identifier.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/StateIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/StateIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Transactions

      A Transaction is an atomic state update to the ledger. It consists of one or
      more OperationGroups, each of which consist of one or more Operations.

      ![Transaction Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/transaction_operations.png)

      A Committed Transaction has additional information such as the State Identifier
      which results after committing the transaction.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CommittedTransaction" exampleRef="#/components/examples/CommittedTransaction" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Operation Groups

      Similar to the [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/), both reading and
      writing to the ledger use the same Address and Operation objects.

      Every state change is expressed as an Operation which operates on a single
      Entity. Any state change which consists of two accounts (such as
      a token transfer) thus requires at least two Operations, one which debits
      the sender and one which credits the receiver.

      Unlike Rosetta, operations are more explicitly linked via Operation Groups. Each
      Operation Group then represents a well formed accounting entry where credits
      and debits are equivalent (unless minting or burning occurred).

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/OperationGroup" exampleRef="#/components/examples/OperationGroup" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Operations

      Operations operate on a single Entity and are associated with a single Amount
      update and/or a single Data update.

      * The `amount` property represents either a positive or negative change in balance of some token.
      * The `data` property represents either the creation or deletion of a data object.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Operation" exampleRef="#/components/examples/Operation" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Entity Identifiers

      An Entity Identifier uniquely describes an entity which may have arbitrary balances and arbitrary data
      objects. An Entity Identifier may further specify a Sub Address which should be treated as a separate
      unique entity.

      The interpretation of Entity Identifiers is discussed in detail in the Structure section.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/EntityIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/EntityIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Amounts

      A signed amount of a resource.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ResourceAmount" exampleRef="#/components/examples/ResourceAmount" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Resource Identifiers

      A Resource Identifier uniquely describes either some token or stake units for a validator.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ResourceIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/ResourceIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Data Updates

      A Data update is the creation or destruction of a data object.

      At any given time, an address will have up to one created-but-not-deleted data object of each type.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Data" exampleRef="#/components/examples/Data" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />
  - name: structure
    x-displayName: Structure
    description: |
      There are different types of entities on Radix, each of which can contain certain resources and data
      objects.

      The following table describes which resources and data objects are allowed for a given type of entity.

      ![Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/structure.png '#width=500px;')

      Overall, there are four main types of entities on Radix:
      * **Account** is a regular public key account which can contain token balances and contain
      StakeUnits, which represents a delegated amount of stake to a specific validator. Subentities under
      an account-address contain assets which the account-address owns but is currently locked by the system.
      An account is represented by its Bech32 account address.
      * **Validator** is an entity representing a validating node on the network. The subentity `system` holds XRD
      tokens which have been staked to this validator. A validator is represented by its Bech32 validator address.
      * **Token** is an entity representing a Token Definition, represented by its Radix Resource Identifier ("RRI").
      * **System** is an entity representing system level data such as current epoch and round, represented by the string "system".

      If an entity identifier references a sub-entity, it should be considered a separate entity to the primary entity.
      For example, for tracking the balance of an Account entity, any operations against an entity identifier
      with a non-empty `entity_identifier.sub_entity` should be ignored, even if the `entity_identifier.address` matches.



  - name: addressing
    x-displayName: Addressing
    description: |
      Account addresses, Validator addresses and Token RRIs are all [Bech32 encoded](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki).

      A Bech32 encoding consists of a prefix which is an ASCII human readable part "HRP", followed by the character "1",
      followed by an encoded data payload, encoded as 32 values (5 bits) per character.

      Assuming an address is legal, you can extract its HRP as the string before the last '1'. This can be used to
      distinguish between Account, Validator and Token/RRI addresses.

      * **Accounts** have a fixed HRP for a given Radix network. This is `rdx` on mainnet. The data part encodes the account's public key.
      * **Validators** have a fixed HRP for a given Radix network. This is `rv` on mainnet. The data part encodes the validator's public key.
      * **Tokens** have an HRP of the token's (not necessarily unique) symbol, followed by a suffix.
        The suffix is fixed for a given Radix network, and is `_rr` on mainnet.
        As an example, the mainnet address of the native token, XRD, is `xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh`.
        The data part of the Bech32 encoding encodes the token's unique radix engine address on ledger.
        This radix engine address is hex `01` for XRD,
        and presently, hex `03 | SHA256(SHA256(signer_public_key_compressed_33_bytes | symbol_in_utf8_bytes)`
        for user-created tokens, where | denotes the byte concatenation operator.

      The Account and Validator HRPs and the Token HRP suffix for the current network should be fetched from the
      `/network/configuration` endpoint.

      It likely will not be necessary to actually decode the data parts of the Bech32 encodings, but if you do need to,
      you should be warned that Radix addresses are *not* Segwit addresses. Many Bech32 libraries assume a Segwit
      encoding, so may fail to extract the data from a Radix address.

      In particular, the Segwit encoding assumes the first 5-bit-character of the 5-bit-per-character encoded data is a
      witness version, and that this is followed by the witness programme bytes, encoded into 5-bit chunks, padded
      with zeroes if necessary. Radix encoding just encodes its data bytes into 5-bit chunks with padded zeroes -
      _without_ an initial single character version prefix. In other words, the padding and interpretation of the
      encoded data differs between Radix and Segwit addresses.

      There are further restrictions on which resource movement and data updates and how operations must
      be combined. The following table describes what user actions (ledger updates that can be submitted
      as a transaction) are available.

      ![User Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/update-documentation/core/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/user_actions.png '#width=500px;')

      1. **Transfer** of any token resource (including the native token XRD) from an account to another
      account may be done by debiting an amount from the sending account and crediting the same amount
      to the receiving account. **Minting** and **Burning** of tokens may also be done if one has
      permissions to do so.
      2. **Staking** may be started by transferring XRD from an account to a `prepared_stake` entity
      with a specific validator. Once XRD is in this entity, at some point the system will move this
      XRD to a Validator entity and mint StakeUnits into the originating account.
      3. **Unstaking** may be started by transfering StakeUnits from an account to a `prepared_unstake`
      entity. Once StakeUnits is in this entity, at some point the system will destroy this
      StakeUnits and transfer XRD from the Validator entity into your `exiting_stake` entity. Once
      the unlocking period is over the system will move that XRD from the `exiting_stake` entity into your
      account.
      4. **Validator Updates** may be started by destroying the current data object and creating a new
      data object with the same type.
      5. **New Token Definitions** may be created by destroying an `UnclaimedREAddr` and creating a
      `TokenData` and `TokenMetadata` data object.
  - name: xrd_transfer_example
    x-displayName: Send XRD
    description: |
      Let's now go through an example of how to transfer XRD using the API.

      For the purpose of our example, let's say we want to:
      > TRANSFER
      > 10.5 XRD
      > FROM
      > rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88
      > TO
      > rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33


      ## Entity Identifiers

      First we need to specify the entities identifiers to be used. In our case,
      we have two entity identifiers, one for the sender and one for the receiver.

      Sender Entity Identifier:
      ```
      EntityIdentifier sender() {
        return new EntityIdentifier()
          .address("rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88");
      }
      ```

      Receiver Entity Identifier:
      ```
      EntityIdentifier receiver() {
        return new EntityIdentifier()
          .address("rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33");
      }
      ```

      ## Resource Identifiers

      Next we will need the Resource Identifier for the XRD Token which will be transferred.
      XRD is Radix ledger's native token, used for staking and to pay fees. It is the only
      token allowed with the symbol `xrd`, and has a reserved radix engine address of `1`
      (`01` in hex).

      On mainnet, its RRI is xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh and it's resource identifier is:
      ```
      TokenResourceIdentifier token() {
        return new TokenResourceIdentifier()
          .rri("xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh")
          .type("Token");
      }
      ```

      ## Amounts

      Given our resource identifier we can now create resource balance changes. This will
      be expressed as a Resource Amount. All amounts are expressed as `10^-18` subunits.
      Thus, since we are transferring `1.5 XRD` this translates to a value of
      `1500000000000000000` or the following amounts:

      Sender Amount:
      ```
      Amount senderAmount() {
        return new Amount()
          .resourceIdentifier(token())
          .value("-1500000000000000000");
      }
      ```

      Receiver Amount:
      ```
      Amount receiverAmount() {
        return new Amount()
          .resourceIdentifier(token())
          .value("1500000000000000000");
      }
      ```

      ## Operations

      We now combine our amounts with our Entity Identifiers to create Operations.
      `"Resource"` is the type of our Operation since we are manipulating resource balances.

      Sender Operation:
      ```
      Operation senderOperation() {
        return new Operation()
          .entityIdentifier(sender())
          .amount(senderAmount())
          .type("Resource");
      }
      ```

      Receiver Operation:
      ```
      Operation receiverOperation() {
        return new Operation()
          .entityIdentifier(receiver())
          .amount(receiverAmount())
          .type("Resource");
      }
      ```

      ## Operation Group

      We then combine operations into a group. Note that the sender operation must be first.

      ```
      OperationGroup operationGroup() {
        return new OperationGroup()
          .addOperationsItem(senderOperation())
          .addOperationsItem(receiverOperation());
      }
      ```

      ## Fee Payer

      The last thing we need to add is to specify the fee payer account entity identifier.
      In this case it will be the same account as the sender.

      We can now also add the `network_identifier` and with this structure we can submit this
      to `/construction/build`. This `network_identifier` needs to match the network identifier
      of the node.

      ```
      ConstructionBuildRequest constructionBuildRequest() {
        return new ConstructionBuildRequest()
          .addOperationsGroupItem(operationGroup())
          .feePayer(sender())
          .networkIdentifier(new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet"));
      }

      void main() {
        ConstructionApi api = new ConstructionApi();
        ConstructionBuildRequest request = constructionBuildRequest();
        ConstructionBuildResponse response = api.constructionBuildPost(request);
      }
      ```

      ## Unsigned Transaction

      After submitting to `/construction/build`, we can take the `unsigned_transaction` and parse it
      through `/construction/parse`.

      ```
      ConstructionApi api = new ConstructionApi();

      ConstructionParseResponse sendParseRequest(String unsignedTransactionHex) {
        ConstructionParseRequest request = new ConstructionParseRequest()
          .unsignedTransaction(unsignedTransactionHex);
        return api.constructionParsePost(request);
      }

      void main() {
        ConstructionBuildRequest request = constructionBuildRequest();
        ConstructionBuildResponse response = api.constructionBuildPost(request);
        String unsignedTransactionHex = response.getUnsignedTransaction();
        ConstructionParseResponse response = sendParseRequest(unsigendTransactionHex);
        System.out.println(response);
      }
      ```

      The response in json would look like:
      ```

          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      A couple of things to note above:
      * There are two operation groups now as opposed to one, the first operation group contains the operations for
      the fee, which should be paid by the `fee_payer` passed into `/construction/build`
      * The second operation group contains more than the two original operations. What occurred here is the node
      selected specific UTXOs to destroy and create (specified by the `substate` property) to perform the intent
      of the operations initially passed in. That is, the balance changes of each entity should still be equivalent
      to the original operations.

      ## Signed Transaction

      Once `payload_to_sign` has been signed, the original payload along with signature can be sent to
      `/construction/finalize` in order to get a `signed_transaction`. This can then be submitted to
      `construction/submit`. You have successfully submitted an XRD transfer transaction!

      ```
      ConstructionApi api = new ConstructionApi();

      void main() {
        ConstructionBuildRequest request = constructionBuildRequest();
        ConstructionBuildResponse response = api.constructionBuildPost(request);
        String unsignedTransactionHex = response.getUnsignedTransaction();
        String payloadToSignHex = response.getPayloadToSign();

        Signature signature = sign(payloadToSignHex);

        ConstructionFinalizeRequest finalizeRequest = new ConstructionFinalizeRequest()
          .unsignedTransaction(unsignedTransactionHex)
          .signature(signature)
          .networkIdentifier(new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet"));
        ConstructionFinalizeResponse finalizeResponse = api.constructionFinalizePost(finalizeRequest);

        String signedTransactionHex = finalizeResponse.getSignedTransaction();
        ConstructionSubmitRequest submitRequest = new ConstructionSubmitRequest()
          .networkIdentifier(new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet"))
          .signedTransaction(signedTransactionHex);
        ConstructionSubmitResponse submitResponse = api.constructionSubmitPost(submitRequest);
      }
      ```

  - name: track_xrd_example
    x-displayName: Track XRD Balances
    description: |

      This example walks through how to track XRD balances across all accounts. To do this we need the following:
      * OpenAPI generated client code, in our example we will use the java version: [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java]
      * A database, in our example we will just use a transient Hashmap

      ## Get Transactions

      Let's start by performing a call to `/transactions` with `state_version` of `0` and `limit`
      of `1000`. This will retrieve the first 1000 transactions on ledger, including the genesis
      transaction.

      Be sure to also match the `network_identifier` with the network the node is using.

      ```
      {
        "network_identifier": {
          "network": "mainnet"
        },
        "state_identifier": {
          "state_version": 0
        },
        "limit": 1000
      }
      ```

      The corresponding java client code looks like:

      ```java
      TransactionsApi api = new TransactionsApi();
      NetworkIdentifier networkIdentifier = new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet");

      void main() {
        PartialStateIdentifier stateIdentifier = new PartialStateIdentifier().stateVersion(0L);

        CommittedTransactionsRequest committedTransactionsRequest = new CommittedTransactionsRequest()
          .networkIdentifier(networkIdentifier)
          .limit(1000L)
          .stateIdentifier(stateIdentifier);

        CommittedTransactionsResponse response = api.transactionsPost(committedTransactionsRequest);
      }
      ```

      ## Get XRD Balance changes

      Let's now expand our code to extract all XRD balance changes.

      To extract account token balance changes in a transaction:
      1. Flatmap to operations from all operation groups
      2. Filter for operations which concern the XRD token, that is:
          1. `amount` exists
          2. `amount.resource_identifier.type` is `Token`
          3. `rri` of the token is `xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh`
      3. Group by `entity_identifier` and sum each `balance_change`

      This gives us the change in XRD balance in that entity due to the transaction, in units of 10^(-18).

      This forms the basis of tracking account balances over time.

      ```java
      TransactionsApi api = new TransactionsApi();
      NetworkIdentifier networkIdentifier = new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet");

      /**
       * Returns true if the operation contains an XRD balance change, otherwise returns false
       */
      boolean isXrd(Operation operation) {
        if (operation.getAmount() == null) {
          return false;
        }
        ResourceIdentifier identifier = op.getAmount().getResourceIdentifier();
        if (!(identifier instanceof TokenResourceIdentifier)) {
          return false;
        }
        TokenResourceIdentifier tokenResourceIdentifier = (TokenResourceIdentifier) identifier;
        return tokenResourceIdentifier.getRri().equals("xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh");
      }

      /**
       * Returns the XRD balance change which occured on every entity from a set
       * of operation groups.
       */
      Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> operationGroupsToBalanceChanges(Stream<OperationGroup> operationGroups) {
        return operationGroups
          .flatMap(group -> group.getOperations().stream())
          .filter(this::isXrd)
          .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
            Operation::getEntityIdentifier,
            Collectors.mapping(
              op -> new BigInteger(op.getAmount().getValue()),
              Collectors.reducing(BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger::add)
            )
          ));
      }

      void main() {
        PartialStateIdentifier stateIdentifier = new PartialStateIdentifier().stateVersion(0L);

        CommittedTransactionsRequest committedTransactionsRequest = new CommittedTransactionsRequest()
          .networkIdentifier(networkIdentifier)
          .limit(1000L)
          .stateIdentifier(stateIdentifier);

        CommittedTransactionsResponse response = api.transactionsPost(committedTransactionsRequest);

        // Extract out operation groups
        Stream<OperationGroup> operationGroups = response.getTransactions().stream()
          .flatMap(txn -> txn.getOperationGroups().stream());

        Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> balanceChanges = operationGroupsToBalanceChanges(operationGroups);
      }
      ```

      ## Update Balance Store

      Now that we can compute balance change we can now start updating some balance store.

      In this example we simply use a hash map from entity to balance. In your system you may
      store these changes in a persistent database.

      ```java
      TransactionsApi api = new TransactionsApi();
      NetworkIdentifier networkIdentifier = new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet");

      /**
       * Our balance store
       */
      Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> balances = new HashMap<>();

      /**
       * Returns true if the operation contains an XRD balance change, otherwise returns false
       */
      boolean isXrd(Operation operation) {
        if (operation.getAmount() == null) {
          return false;
        }
        ResourceIdentifier identifier = op.getAmount().getResourceIdentifier();
        if (!(identifier instanceof TokenResourceIdentifier)) {
          return false;
        }
        TokenResourceIdentifier tokenResourceIdentifier = (TokenResourceIdentifier) identifier;
        return tokenResourceIdentifier.getRri().equals("xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh");
      }

      /**
       * Returns the XRD balance change which occured on every entity from a set
       * of operation groups.
       */
      Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> operationGroupsToBalanceChanges(Stream<OperationGroup> operationGroups) {
        return operationGroups
          .flatMap(group -> group.getOperations().stream())
          .filter(this::isXrd)
          .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
            Operation::getEntityIdentifier,
            Collectors.mapping(
              op -> new BigInteger(op.getAmount().getValue()),
              Collectors.reducing(BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger::add)
            )
          ));
      }

      /**
       * Updates the balance store.
       */
      void updateStore(Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> balanceChanges) {
        balanceChanges.forEach((identifier, value) -> balances.merge(identifier, value, BigInteger::add));
      }

      void main() throws ApiException {
        PartialStateIdentifier stateIdentifier = new PartialStateIdentifier().stateVersion(0L);

        CommittedTransactionsRequest committedTransactionsRequest = new CommittedTransactionsRequest()
          .networkIdentifier(networkIdentifier)
          .limit(1000L)
          .stateIdentifier(stateIdentifier);

        CommittedTransactionsResponse response = api.transactionsPost(committedTransactionsRequest);

        // Extract out operation groups
        Stream<OperationGroup> operationGroups = response.getTransactions().stream()
          .flatMap(txn -> txn.getOperationGroups().stream());

        Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> balanceChanges = operationGroupsToBalanceChanges(operationGroups);
        updateStore(balanceChanges);
      }
      ```

      ## Continual Sync

      So far we've only been requesting for the initial 1000 transactions on ledger. We will now want to
      continually sync as the ledger progresses.

      To do this, we will keep our own current stateVersion and update it with the latest stateVersion
      we've seen. On a persistent database, it will be important to update the stateVersion and ledger updates
      atomically so that the sync process can handle process crashes gracefully and restart in a consistent
      manner.

      We can now add continually check for updates on ledger and keep our own state up to date. This can
      easily look something like a cronjob process which periodically updates a local database.

      ```java
      TransactionsApi api = new TransactionsApi();
      NetworkIdentifier networkIdentifier = new NetworkIdentifier().network("mainnet");

      /**
       * Our balance store
       */
      long currentStateVersion = 0;
      Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> balances = new HashMap<>();

      /**
       * Returns true if the operation contains an XRD balance change, otherwise returns false
       */
      boolean isXrd(Operation operation) {
        if (operation.getAmount() == null) {
          return false;
        }
        ResourceIdentifier identifier = op.getAmount().getResourceIdentifier();
        if (!(identifier instanceof TokenResourceIdentifier)) {
          return false;
        }
        TokenResourceIdentifier tokenResourceIdentifier = (TokenResourceIdentifier) identifier;
        return tokenResourceIdentifier.getRri().equals("xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh");
      }

      /**
       * Returns the XRD balance change which occured on every entity from a set
       * of operation groups.
       */
      Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> operationGroupsToBalanceChanges(Stream<OperationGroup> operationGroups) {
        return operationGroups
          .flatMap(group -> group.getOperations().stream())
          .filter(this::isXrd)
          .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
            Operation::getEntityIdentifier,
            Collectors.mapping(

              Collectors.reducing(BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger::add)
            )
          ));
      }

      /**
       * Retrieves the current state version
       */
      long loadStateVersion() {
        return this.currentStateVersion;
      }

      /**

      void updateStore(long currentStateVersion, long nextStateVersion, Map<EntityIdentifier, BigInteger> balanceChanges) {
        // Sanity check, in case we have multiple updater to our store
        assert(this.currentStateVersion == currentStateVersion);

        this.currentStateVersion = nextStateVersion;
        balanceChanges.forEach((identifier, value) -> balances.merge(identifier, value, BigInteger::add));
      }

      /**
       * Requests for new transactions from a node and then updates the balance store
       */
      void update() throws ApiException {
        long stateVersion = loadStateVersion();
        PartialStateIdentifier stateIdentifier = new PartialStateIdentifier().stateVersion(stateVersion);

        CommittedTransactionsRequest committedTransactionsRequest = new CommittedTransactionsRequest()
          .networkIdentifier(networkIdentifier)
          .limit(1000L)

        updateStore(stateVersion, nextStateVersion, balanceChanges);
      }

      void main() throws Exception {
        while (true) {
          update();
          Thread.sleep(1000L);

      ## Advanced

      ### Filtering to just account balances

      The above examples pull through the balances for any Entity, but typically you'll just want to pull down
      usable balances in an account - that is, balances against an account entity.

      To do this, we can check filter `entity_identifier` to those which have an `address` starting `rdx1`,
      and no `sub_entity`. We filter out sub-entities because these are separate entities/balances to the
      core account, used by the system for staking.

      For more information, and to support non-mainnet addresses, see the Structure and Addressing sections.

      ### Supporting networks other than mainnet

      See the Addressing section for details on determining non-mainnet addresses.

      ### Tracking UTXOs

      The `operation.substate.substate_identifier.identifier` gives a hex-encoded identifier for the UTXO used in that
      transaction. If `operation.substate.substate_operation` is `BOOTUP`, the UTXO was created, and if `SHUTDOWN`, it
      was spent.

      This can be used to track live UTXOs.

      ### Consistency checks

      Before saving a copy of a transaction to an index, you should check that the parent accumulator matches the
      accumulator you have on record. Whilst we don't anticipate a need to rollback the ledger, this accumulator
      check could be used to detect this (and can be used to rollback an index to the point where the accumulators
      agree).

      If you wish to also check the consistency of this accumulator, the following should be true:

      `post_transaction_state_accumulator = SHA256(SHA256(pre_transaction_state_accumulator | transaction_identifier_hash))`

      Where `|` is the byte concatenation operator. Note that this uses two rounds of SHA256. The first maps from
      64 bytes to 32 bytes, the second from 32 bytes to 32 bytes.

      ### Timestamps

      If you care about the timestamps that various transactions were committed, you can track the `RoundData`
      data object under the `system` entity.

      Then, `timestamp` in `RoundData` gives a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds, derived from votes of each validator
      of what the current wall clock time is. It is _not_ guaranteed to be increasing and should only be used for
      convenience and not as an accurate representation of the actual time of commit.
