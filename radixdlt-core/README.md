# radixdlt-core

radixdlt-core is Radix's core consensus and networking module for the [Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com)
Distributed Ledger. It includes a variant implementation of the [HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069) BFT-style consensus.

## Building
Clone the required repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt.git
```

Checkout the required branch:
```
cd radixdlt && git checkout release/1.0-beta.23
```

Run tests (note that integration tests take several minutes to run):
```
./gradlew test integrationTest
```
Unfortunately the integration tests currently use hardcoded TCP/UDP port
numbers 12345 and 23456, and may fail if these ports are not available on
your machine.  We plan to fix this.

## Launching
You will need docker and docker-compose installed to launch a node.  We use
[Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).

We generate initial validator keys and genesis/universe at launch time, so the easiest way to launch a set of nodes is to use the startup script provided.

```
./docker/scripts/rundocker.sh 2
```
The number indicates the count of nodes to include in the configuration.  Configuration files are provided for node counts between 1 and 5 inclusive.  Note that each node requires approximately 1GiB of RAM.

If you need to run `docker-compose` using `sudo`, this can be specified on the command line as well:

```
DOCKER_COMPOSE_LAUNCH="sudo -E docker-compose" ./docker/scripts/rundocker.sh 2
```
Note that the `-E` flag is required here, as startup information such as keys and universe configuration generated by the script is provided in environment variables.

API interface can be accessed via localhost:8080, eg:

```
curl localhost:8080/api/universe
```
