/**
 * This class represents a NTP message, as specified in RFC 2030.  The message
 * format is compatible with all versions of NTP and SNTP.
 * <p>
 * This class does not support the optional authentication protocol, and
 * ignores the key ID and message digest fields.
 * <p>
 * For convenience, this class exposes message values as native Java types, not
 * the NTP-specified data formats.  For example, timestamps are
 * stored as doubles (as opposed to the NTP unsigned 64-bit fixed point
 * format).
 * <p>
 * However, the contructor NtpMessage(byte[]) and the method toByteArray()
 * allow the import and export of the raw NTP message format.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Usage example
 * <p>
 * // Send message
 * DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();
 * InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("ntp.cais.rnp.br");
 * byte[] buf = new NtpMessage().toByteArray();
 * DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, address, 123);
 * socket.send(packet);
 * <p>
 * // Get response
 * socket.receive(packet);
 * System.out.println(msg.toString());
