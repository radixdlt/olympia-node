/**
 * Rotates leaders with those having more power being proposed more often
 * in proportion to the amount of power they have.
 *
 * Calculation of the next leader is dependent on the weight state of the
 * previous view and thus computing the leader for an arbitrary view can
 * be quite expensive.
 *
 * We resolve this by keeping a cache of some given size of the previous
 * views closest to the highest view calculated.
 *
 * This class stateful and is NOT thread-safe.
