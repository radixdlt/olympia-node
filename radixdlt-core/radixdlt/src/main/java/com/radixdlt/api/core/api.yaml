  title: Radix Core API
  description: |
    This API provides endpoints for both RadixCore node management and support
    for middleware integration (such as exchanges).

    # Introduction

    Welcome to the Radix Core API Preview. This Preview API is intended for
    exchanges to be able to begin integrating with the Radix network. In particular,
    the following endpoints will be frozen or at the very least backwards
    compatible to version 1.0.0 of the Radix Core API:

    * `/network/configuration`
    * `/network/status`
    * `/transactions`
    * `/construction/derive`
    * `/construction/build`
    * `/construction/parse`
    * `/construction/finalize`
    * `/construction/hash`
    * `/construction/submit`

    All other endpoints may change by the 1.0.0 release, and further endpoints
    (such as mempool contents) will likely be added.

    > WARNING
    >
    > This API is __NOT__ intended to be available on the public web and is designed
    > to be used in private networks mainly for node management and integration.
    > In particular, endpoints in the Signing API if accessed by the public can
    > result in loss of funds.

    # Radix Network Gateway

    We are building our own service against the Core API, and will be able to publish
    the preview source code for this soon. Other integrators will be able to run this service,
    or use the source code as a reference implementation to develop their own integrations.

    # Rosetta

    Much of the design decisions of the Data API and Construction API endpoints is
    inspired from [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) most notably:
      * Use of a JSON-Based RPC protocol on top of HTTP Post requests
      * Use of Operations, Amounts, and Identifiers to express generic asset movement

    There are a few notable exceptions to note:
      * Fetching of ledger data is through a Transaction stream rather than a
      Block stream
      * Use of `EntityIdentifier` rather than `AccountIdentifier`
      * Use of `OperationGroup` rather than `related_operations` to express related
      operations
      * Even though the Radix Ledger is UTXO based, Construction endpoints perform coin
      selection on behalf of the caller. This has the unfortunate effect of not
      being able to support high frequency transactions from a single account due to
      UTXO spend conflicts. This will be addressed in future updates.
      * Construction endpoints are mostly online rather than offline as required by
      Rosetta

    Future versions of the api will aim towards a fully-compliant Rosetta API.

    # Data API Sequence Flow

    Clients can make use of the Data API endpoints to synchronize
    either a full or partial view (for example, to only track XRD asset balances) of
    the ledger, transaction by transaction.

    Synchronization involves only using the Data API. Assuming the client has a
    database which they are updating, below is a generic flow of operations on
    how to synchronize via the Data API.

    ![Data Sequence Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/data_sequence_flow.png)


    # Construction API Sequence Flow

    Clients can make use of the Construction API endpoints to construct and submit
    transactions to the network.

    The following sequence flow allows for integrators to construct transactions
    on behalf of clients or for their own use without ever holding the actual private
    key.

    ![Construction Sequence Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/construction_sequence_flow.png)

    Unlike the Rosetta Construction API [specification](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html),
    this Construction API selects the UTXOs on behalf of the caller. This has the unfortunate
    side effect of not being able to support high frequency transactions from a single
    account due to UTXO conflicts. This will be addressed in a future release.

      Entities represent something that can hold resource balances and data objects.
      A public key account is the simplest example of an entity.

      ![State Identifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/entity.png '#width=500px;')

      At the simplest level of abstraction, each Operation in a Transaction is simply
      either a resource balance change or a data object update in an entity.

      ![State Identifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/operation.png '#width=500px;')

      ## State Identifiers
      The Radix Olympia network has no concept of blocks, instead transactions are
      managed in a flat ordered list. A hash chain is formed from these transactions
      which represents a point in time of the ledger with a valid committed state.

      ![State Identifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/state_identifiers.png '#width=500px;')

      Along with the transaction accumulator hash and the index of the hash in the hash
      chain, this forms a State Identifier:
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/StateIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/StateIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Transactions

      A Transaction consists of one or more OperationGroups, each of which consist of
      one or more Operations.

      ![Transaction Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/transaction_operations.png)

      A Committed Transaction has additional information such as the StateIdentifier
      which resulted after committing the transaction.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CommittedTransaction" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Operation Groups

      Similar to the [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/), both reading and
      writing to the ledger use the same Address and Operation objects.

      Every state change is expressed as an Operation which operates on a single
      Entity. Any state change which consists of two accounts (such as
      a token transfer) thus requires at least two Operations, one which debits
      the sender and one which credits the receiver.

      Unlike Rosetta, operations are more explicitly linked via Operation Groups. Each
      Operation Group then represents a well formed accounting entry where credits
      and debits are equivalent (unless minting or burning occurred).

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/OperationGroup" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Operations

      Operations operate on a single Entity and are associated with a single Amount
      update and/or a single Data update.

      * The `amount` property represents either a positive or negative change in balance of some token.
      * The `data` property represents either the creation or deletion of a data object.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Operation" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Entity Identifiers

      An Entity Identifier uniquely describes an entity which may have arbitrary balances and arbitrary data
      objects. An Entity Identifier may further specify a Sub Address which should be treated as a separate
      unique entity.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/EntityIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Amounts

      A signed amount of a resource.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ResourceAmount" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Resource Identifiers

      A Resource Identifier uniquely describes either some token or stake ownership of a validator.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ResourceIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Data Updates

      A Data update is the creation or destruction of a data object.

      At any given time, an address will have up to one created-but-not-deleted data object of each type.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Data" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

    x-displayName: Structure
    description: |
      With just the object descriptions, you have all the info needed to integrate a system that can track
      generics assets and balances of entities and allow for generic asset transfer.

      For more sophisticated use, such as staking, you need to understand the structure and relationships of
      specific entities, resources, and data. For example, to stake XRD to a validator you must transfer XRD
      from your account address to your `prepared_staked` subaddress.

      The following is a high level table describing which resources and data objects are allowed for a given
      entity identifier.

      ![Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/structure.png '#width=500px;')

      There are four types of entities:
      * **Account**, which is a regular public key account which can contain token balances and contain
      StakeOwnership, which represents a delegated amount of stake to a specific validator. Subaddresses under
      an account-address contain assets which the account-address owns but is currently locked by the system.
      An account is represented by its Bech32 account address.
      * **Validator**, an entity representing a validating node on the network. The subaddress `system` holds XRD
      tokens which have been staked to this validator. A validator is represented by its Bech32 validator address.
      * **Token**, an entity representing a token, represented by its Radix Resource Identifier ("RRI").
      * **System**, an entity representing system level data such as current epoch and round, represented by the string "system".

      ## Bech32 Address Encoding

      Account addresses, Validator addresses and Token RRIs are all [Bech32 encoded](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki).

      A Bech32 encoding consists of a prefix which is an ASCII human readable part "HRP", followed by the character "1",
      followed by an encoded data payload, encoded as 32 values (5 bits) per character.

      Assuming an address is legal, you can extract its HRP as the string before the last '1'. This can be used to
      distinguish between Account, Validator and Token/RRI addresses.

      * **Accounts** have a fixed HRP for a given Radix network. This is `rdx` on mainnet. The data part encodes the account's public key.
      * **Validators** have a fixed HRP for a given Radix network. This is `rv` on mainnet. The data part encodes the validator's public key.
      * **Tokens** have an HRP of the token's (not necessarily unique) symbol, followed by a suffix.
        The suffix is fixed for a given Radix network, and is `_rr` on mainnet.
        As an example, the mainnet address of the native token, XRD, is `xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh`.
        The data part of the Bech32 encoding encodes the token's unique radix engine address on ledger.

      The Account and Validator HRPs and the Token HRP suffix for the current network should be fetched from the
      `/network/configuration` endpoint.

      It likely will not be necessary to actually decode the data parts of the Bech32 encodings, but if you do need to,
      you should be warned that Radix addresses are *not* Segwit addresses. Many Bech32 libraries assume a Segwit
      encoding, so may fail to extract the data from a Radix address.

      In particular, the Segwit encoding assumes the first 5-bit-character of the 5-bit-per-character encoded data is a
      witness version, and that this is followed by the witness programme bytes, encoded into 5-bit chunks, padded
      with zeroes if necessary. Radix encoding just encodes its data bytes into 5-bit chunks with padded zeroes -
      _without_ an initial 1 character version prefix. In other words, the padding and interpretation of the encoded
      data differs between Radix and Segwit addresses.

      ## The native token: XRD

      XRD is Radix ledger's native token, used for staking and to pay transaction fees. It has the symbol `xrd`, and
      no other token is permitted to use this symbol. It has a reserved radix engine address of `1` (`01` in hex).

      On mainnet, its RRI is `xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh`.

  - name: actions
    x-displayName: Actions
    description: |

      There are further restrictions on which resource movement and data updates and how operations must
      be combined. The following describes at a high level what user actions (ledger updates that can be
      submitted as a transaction) are available.

      ![User Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/user_actions.png '#width=500px;')

      1. **Transfer** of any token resource (including the native token XRD) from an account to another
      account may be done by debiting an amount from the sending account and crediting the same amount
      to the receiving account.
      2. **Staking** may be started by transferring XRD from an account to a `prepared_stake` entity
      with a specific validator. Once XRD is in this entity, at some point the system will move this
      XRD to a Validator entity and mint StakeOwnership into the originating account.
      3. **Unstaking** may be started by transfering StakeOwnership from an account to a `prepared_unstake`
      entity. Once StakeOwnership is in this entity, at some point the system will destroy this
      StakeOwnership and transfer XRD from the Validator entity into your `exiting_stake` entity. Once
      the unlocking period is over the system will move that XRD from the `exiting_stake` entity into your
      account.
      4. **Validator Updates** may be started by destroying the current data object and creating a new
      data object with the same type.
      5. **New Token Definitions** may be created by destroying an `UnclaimedREAddr` and creating a
      `TokenData` and `TokenMetadata` data object.
