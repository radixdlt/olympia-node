  title: Radix Core API
  description: |
    This API provides endpoints for radix network integrators.

    # Overview

    > WARNING
    >
    > The Core API is __NOT__ intended to be available on the public web. It is
    > mainly designed to be accessed in a private network for integration use.

    Welcome to the Radix Core API version 0.9.0 for Integrators. Version 0.9.0
    is intended for integrators who wish to begin the process of developing an
    integration between the Radix ledger and their own systems.

    The Core API is separated into two:
    * The **Data API** is a read-only api which allows integrators to view and
    sync to the state of the ledger.
    * The **Construction API** allows integrators to construct and submit a
    transaction to the network on behalf of a key holder.

    The Core API is not a full replacement for the current Node and Archive APIs
    (as currently documented at docs.radixdlt.com), but is intended to be the
    main private API exposed by a node. We are also working on a public-facing
    Gateway API that will be part of a full "new API", but is yet to be finalised.

    The Core API is primarily designed for network integrations, where integrators
    will run their own full node.

    We should stress that this API is in preview, and should __not__ be deployed
    into production until v1 has been finalised in an official Radix node release.

    ## Backwards Compatibility

    The openapi specification of all endpoints in Version 0.9.0 is intended to be
    backwards compatible with version 1.0.0 once released, so that there is little
    risk that clients working with this spec will break after the release of 1.0.0.
    Additional endpoints (such as retrieving mempool contents) are planned to be added.

    ## Rosetta

    The Data API and Construction API is inspired from [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/)
    most notably:
      * Use of a JSON-Based RPC protocol on top of HTTP Post requests
      * Use of Operations, Amounts, and Identifiers as universal language to
      express asset movement for reading and writing

    There are a few notable exceptions to note:
      * Fetching of ledger data is through a Transaction stream rather than a
      Block stream
      * Use of `EntityIdentifier` rather than `AccountIdentifier`
      * Use of `OperationGroup` rather than `related_operations` to express related
      operations
      * Construction endpoints perform coin selection on behalf of the caller.
      This has the unfortunate effect of not being able to support high frequency
      transactions from a single account. This will be addressed in future updates.
      * Construction endpoints are online rather than offline as required by Rosetta

    Future versions of the api will aim towards a fully-compliant Rosetta API.

    ## Reference Implementation

    We are currently working on a reference implementation of a client to the Core API
    and hope to have this available to share with you soon.

    ## Client Code Generation

    We have found success with generating clients against the [api.yaml specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/api.yaml)
    in the core folder. See https://openapi-generator.tech/ for more details.

    The openapi generator only supports openapi version 3.0.0 at present, but you can
    change 3.1.0 to 3.0.0 in the first line of the spec without affecting generation.

    # Data API Flow

    Integrators can make use of the Data API to synchronize a full or partial view of
    the ledger, transaction by transaction.

    ![Data API Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/data_sequence_flow.png)

    # Construction API Flow

    Integrators can make use of the Construction API to construct and submit transactions
    to the network.

    ![Construction API Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/construction_sequence_flow.png)

    Unlike the Rosetta Construction API [specification](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html),
    this Construction API selects UTXOs on behalf of the caller. This has the unfortunate
    side effect of not being able to support high frequency transactions from a single
    account due to UTXO conflicts. This will be addressed in a future release.

      Entities represent something that can hold resource balances and data objects.
      For example, a public key account is an entity which can hold token balances
      on behalf of a private key holder.

      ![Entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/entity.png '#width=500px;')

      An Operation is an update which occurs on an Entity. There are two types of
      Operations:
      * A **Resource** Operation which is a balance change on an Entity
      * A **Data** Operation which is a data object update on an Entity

      ![Operation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/operation.png '#width=500px;')
  - name: objects
    x-displayName: Objects
    description: |
      ## State Identifiers
      The Radix Olympia network has no concept of blocks. Instead transactions are
      managed in a flat ordered list. A hash chain is formed from these transactions
      called a Transaction Accumulator. A Transaction Accumulator represents a point
      in time of the ledger with a valid state.

      ![State Identifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/state_identifiers.png '#width=500px;')

      The transaction accumulator along with the index forms a State Identifier.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/StateIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/StateIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Transactions

      A Transaction is an atomic state update to the ledger. It consists of one or
      more OperationGroups, each of which consist of one or more Operations.

      ![Transaction Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/transaction_operations.png)

      A Committed Transaction has additional information such as the State Identifier
      which results after committing the transaction.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CommittedTransaction" exampleRef="#/components/examples/CommittedTransaction" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Operation Groups

      Similar to the [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/), both reading and
      writing to the ledger use the same Address and Operation objects.

      Every state change is expressed as an Operation which operates on a single
      Entity. Any state change which consists of two accounts (such as
      a token transfer) thus requires at least two Operations, one which debits
      the sender and one which credits the receiver.

      Unlike Rosetta, operations are more explicitly linked via Operation Groups. Each
      Operation Group then represents a well formed accounting entry where credits
      and debits are equivalent (unless minting or burning occurred).

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/OperationGroup" exampleRef="#/components/examples/OperationGroup" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Operations

      Operations operate on a single Entity and are associated with a single Amount
      update and/or a single Data update.

      * The `amount` property represents either a positive or negative change in balance of some token.
      * The `data` property represents either the creation or deletion of a data object.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Operation" exampleRef="#/components/examples/Operation" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Entity Identifiers

      An Entity Identifier uniquely describes an entity which may have arbitrary balances and arbitrary data
      objects. An Entity Identifier may further specify a Sub Address which should be treated as a separate
      unique entity.

      The interpretation of Entity Identifiers is discussed in detail in the Structure section.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/EntityIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/EntityIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Amounts

      A signed amount of a resource.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ResourceAmount" exampleRef="#/components/examples/ResourceAmount" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Resource Identifiers

      A Resource Identifier uniquely describes either some token or stake ownership of a validator.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ResourceIdentifier" exampleRef="#/components/examples/ResourceIdentifier" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />

      ## Data Updates

      A Data update is the creation or destruction of a data object.

      At any given time, an address will have up to one created-but-not-deleted data object of each type.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Data" exampleRef="#/components/examples/Data" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />
  - name: structure
    x-displayName: Structure
    description: |
      There are different types of entities on Radix, each of which can contain certain resources and data
      objects.

      The following is a high level table describing which resources and data objects are allowed for a given
      entity.

      ![Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/structure.png '#width=500px;')

      Overall, there are four main types of entities on Radix:
      * **Account** is a regular public key account which can contain token balances and contain
      StakeOwnership, which represents a delegated amount of stake to a specific validator. Subentities under
      an account-address contain assets which the account-address owns but is currently locked by the system.
      An account is represented by its Bech32 account address.
      * **Validator** is an entity representing a validating node on the network. The subentity `system` holds XRD
      tokens which have been staked to this validator. A validator is represented by its Bech32 validator address.
      * **Token** is an entity representing a Token Definition, represented by its Radix Resource Identifier ("RRI").
      * **System** is an entity representing system level data such as current epoch and round, represented by the string "system".

      If an entity identifier references a sub-entity, it should be considered a separate entity to the primary entity.
      For example, for tracking the balance of an Account entity, any operations against an entity identifier
      with a non-empty `entity_identifier.sub_entity` should be ignored, even if the `entity_identifier.address` matches.



  - name: addressing
    x-displayName: Addressing
    description: |
      Account addresses, Validator addresses and Token RRIs are all [Bech32 encoded](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki).

      A Bech32 encoding consists of a prefix which is an ASCII human readable part "HRP", followed by the character "1",
      followed by an encoded data payload, encoded as 32 values (5 bits) per character.

      Assuming an address is legal, you can extract its HRP as the string before the last '1'. This can be used to
      distinguish between Account, Validator and Token/RRI addresses.

      * **Accounts** have a fixed HRP for a given Radix network. This is `rdx` on mainnet. The data part encodes the account's public key.
      * **Validators** have a fixed HRP for a given Radix network. This is `rv` on mainnet. The data part encodes the validator's public key.
      * **Tokens** have an HRP of the token's (not necessarily unique) symbol, followed by a suffix.
        The suffix is fixed for a given Radix network, and is `_rr` on mainnet.
        As an example, the mainnet address of the native token, XRD, is `xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh`.
        The data part of the Bech32 encoding encodes the token's unique radix engine address on ledger.

      The Account and Validator HRPs and the Token HRP suffix for the current network should be fetched from the
      `/network/configuration` endpoint.

      It likely will not be necessary to actually decode the data parts of the Bech32 encodings, but if you do need to,
      you should be warned that Radix addresses are *not* Segwit addresses. Many Bech32 libraries assume a Segwit
      encoding, so may fail to extract the data from a Radix address.

      In particular, the Segwit encoding assumes the first 5-bit-character of the 5-bit-per-character encoded data is a
      witness version, and that this is followed by the witness programme bytes, encoded into 5-bit chunks, padded
      with zeroes if necessary. Radix encoding just encodes its data bytes into 5-bit chunks with padded zeroes -
      _without_ an initial single character version prefix. In other words, the padding and interpretation of the
      encoded data differs between Radix and Segwit addresses.

    x-displayName: Actions

      There are further restrictions on which resource movement and data updates and how operations must
      be combined. The following describes at a high level what user actions (ledger updates that can be
      submitted as a transaction) are available.

      ![User Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/user_actions.png '#width=500px;')

      1. **Transfer** of any token resource (including the native token XRD) from an account to another
      account may be done by debiting an amount from the sending account and crediting the same amount
      to the receiving account.
      2. **Staking** may be started by transferring XRD from an account to a `prepared_stake` entity
      with a specific validator. Once XRD is in this entity, at some point the system will move this
      XRD to a Validator entity and mint StakeOwnership into the originating account.
      3. **Unstaking** may be started by transfering StakeOwnership from an account to a `prepared_unstake`
      entity. Once StakeOwnership is in this entity, at some point the system will destroy this
      StakeOwnership and transfer XRD from the Validator entity into your `exiting_stake` entity. Once
      the unlocking period is over the system will move that XRD from the `exiting_stake` entity into your
      account.
      4. **Validator Updates** may be started by destroying the current data object and creating a new
      data object with the same type.
      5. **New Token Definitions** may be created by destroying an `UnclaimedREAddr` and creating a
      `TokenData` and `TokenMetadata` data object.
  - name: xrd_transfer_example
    x-displayName: Perform XRD Transfer
    description: |
      Given the described model let us go through an example of how an XRD transfer transaction may look like.

      For the purpose of our example, let's say we want to:
      > TRANSFER
      > 10.5 XRD
      > FROM
      > rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88
      > TO
      > rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33


      ## Entity Identifiers

      First we need to specify the entities identifiers to be used. In our case,
      we have two entity identifiers, one for the sender and one for the receiver.

      Sender Entity Identifier:
      ```
      {
        "address": "rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88"
      }
      ```

      Receiver Entity Identifier:
      ```
      {
        "address": "rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33"
      }
      ```

      ## Resource Identifiers

      Next we will need the Resource Identifier for the XRD Token which will be transferred.
      XRD is Radix ledger's native token, used for staking and to pay fees. It is the only
      token allowed with the symbol `xrd`, and has a reserved radix engine address of `1`
      (`01` in hex).

      On mainnet, its RRI is xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh and it's resource identifier is:
      ```
      {
        "type": "Token",
        "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
      }
      ```

      ## Amounts

      Given our resource identifier we can now create resource balance changes. This will
      be expressed as a Resource Amount. All amounts are expressed as `10^-18` subunits.
      Thus, since we are transferring `1.5 XRD` this translates to a value of
      `1500000000000000000` or the following amounts:

      Sender Amount:
      ```
      {
        "resource_identifier": {
          "type": "Token",
          "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
        },
        "value": "-1500000000000000000"
      }
      ```

      Receiver Amount:
      ```
      {
        "resource_identifier": {
          "type": "Token",
          "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
        },
        "value": "1500000000000000000"
      }
      ```

      ## Operations

      We now combine our amounts with our Entity Identifiers to create Operations.
      `"Resource"` is the type of our Operation since we are manipulating resource balances.

      Sender Operation:
      ```
      {
        "type": "Resource",
        "entity_identifier": {
          "address": "rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88"
        },
        "amount": {
          "resource_identifier": {
            "type": "Token",
            "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
          },
          "value": "-1500000000000000000"
        }
      }
      ```

      Receiver Operation:
      ```
      {
        "type": "Resource",
        "entity_identifier": {
          "address": "rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33"
        },
        "amount": {
          "resource_identifier": {
            "type": "Token",
            "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
          },
          "value": "1500000000000000000"
        }
      }
      ```

      ## Operation Group

      We then combine operations into a group. Note that the sender operation must be first.

      ```
      {
        "operations": [
          {
            "type": "Resource",
            "entity_identifier": {
              "address": "rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88"
            },
            "amount": {
              "resource_identifier": {
                "type": "Token",
                "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
              },
              "value": "-1500000000000000000"
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "Resource",
            "entity_identifier": {
              "address": "rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33"
            },
            "amount": {
              "resource_identifier": {
                "type": "Token",
                "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
              },
              "value": "1500000000000000000"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      ## Fee Payer

      The last thing we need to add is to specify the fee payer account entity identifier.
      In this case it will be the same account as the sender.

      We can now also add the `network_identifier` and with this structure we can submit this
      to `/construction/build`. This `network_identifier` needs to match the network identifier
      of the node.

      ```
        {
          "network_identifier": {
            "network": "mainnet"
          },
          "fee_payer": {
            "address": "rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88"
          },
          "operation_groups": [
            {
              "operations": [
                {
                  "type": "Resource",
                  "entity_identifier": {
                    "address": "rdx1qspacch6qjqy7awspx304sev3n4em302en25jd87yrh4hp47grr692cm0kv88"
                  },
                  "amount": {
                    "resource_identifier": {
                      "type": "Token",
                      "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
                    },
                    "value": "-1500000000000000000"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "type": "Resource",
                  "entity_identifier": {
                    "address": "rdx1qsp258zf47f288g4y47hm3plsp03370safcjg5x98e6j2h66p5we8ds8m7g33"
                  },
                  "amount": {
                    "resource_identifier": {
                      "type": "Token",
                      "rri": "xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh"
                    },
                    "value": "1500000000000000000"

      ## Unsigned Transaction

      After submitting to `/construction/build`, the output will look something like:

      ```
      {
        "unsigned_transaction": "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",

      ```

      A couple of things to note above:
      * There are two operation groups now as opposed to one, the first operation group contains the operations for
      the fee, which should be paid by the `fee_payer` passed into `/construction/build`
      * The second operation group contains more than the two original operations. What occurred here is the node
      selected specific UTXOs to destroy and create (specified by the `substate` property) to perform the intent
      of the operations initially passed in. That is, the balance changes of each entity should still be equivalent
      to the original operations.

      ## Signed Transaction

      Once `payload_to_sign` has been signed, the original payload along with signature can be sent to
      `/construction/finalize` in order to get a `signed_transaction`. This can then be submitted to
      `construction/submit`. You have successfully submitted a XRD transfer transaction!

  - name: read_transaction_api_example
    x-displayName: Track XRD Balances
    description: |

      This example walks through how to interpret the committed transfers and balances from the Transactions API,
      for the purposes of tracking account balances and UTXOs.

      ## Retrieve transactions

      Perform a call to the `/transactions` address, eg the following call gets the first 100 transactions from the
      ledger. Be sure to match the `network_identifier` with the network the node is using.

      ```
      {
        "network_identifier": {
          "network": "mainnet"
        },
        "state_identifier": {
          "state_version": 0
        },
        "limit": 100
      }
      ```

      You will receive a `state_identifer` corresponding to the ledger state before the first committed transactions
      was committed, and a list of committed transactions.

      Detailed overview of the schema is contained in the Data API/Transactions section, but for now, we'll continue
      the example by extracting out only account balance changes.

      ## Extracting out only account token balance changes

      The format of a transaction will correspond to the object in the `unsigned_transaction` example above,
      with some additional data fields related to the signing and commitment process, which is irrelevant for our
      use case.

      To extract account token balances from a transaction, we can flatmap to all operations across all operation
      groups, and filter to operations which:

      * __Concern an account entity__ - that is, have an `entity_identifier` which has an address starting `rdx1`,
        and no `sub_entity`. We filter out sub-entities because these are separate entities/balances to the
        core account, used by the system for staking.
        For more information, and to support non-mainnet addresses, see the Structure and Addressing sections.
      * __Concern the XRD token__ - that is, they have an `amount`, and this has an `amount.resource_identifier.type` of `Token`.
        In this case, we only care about one particular token, XRD, so you can further filter on
        `amount.resource_identifier.rri` here. EG the `rri` of XRD on mainnet is `xrd_rr1qy5wfsfh`.

      Let `account_address = operation.entity_identifier.address`, and `balance_change = operation.amount.value`.

      Then, group by `account_address` and sum each `balance_change` against that `account_address` from all the
      operations in that transaction. This gives us the change in XRD balance in that account due to the transaction,
      in units of 10^(-18).

      This can form the basis of tracking the account balance over time.

      ## Advanced

      ### Tracking multiple tokens

      You could choose not to filter on XRD rri, and instead also let `token_rri = operation.amount.resource_identifier.rri`
      and group by (account_address, token_rri) during the sum, to get balance changes for that account/token combination.

      ### Tracking UTXOs

      The `operation.substate.substate_identifier.identifier` gives a hex-encoded identifier for the UTXO used in that
      transaction. If `operation.substate.substate_operation` is `BOOTUP`, the UTXO was created, and if `SHUTDOWN`, it
      was spent.

      This can be used to track live UTXOs.

      ### Consistency checks

      Before saving a copy of a transaction to an index, you should check that the parent accumulator matches the
      accumulator you have on record. Whilst we don't anticipate a need to rollback the ledger, this accumulator
      check could be used to detect this (and can be used to rollback an index to the point where the accumulators
      agree).

      If you wish to also check the consistency of this accumulator, the following should be true:

      `post_transaction_state_accumulator = SHA256(SHA256(pre_transaction_state_accumulator | transaction_identifier_hash)`

      Where `|` is the byte concatenation operator. Note that this uses two rounds of SHA256. The first maps from
      64 bytes to 32 bytes, the second from 32 bytes to 32 bytes.

      ### Timestamps

      If you care about the timestamps that various transactions were committed, you can filter for operations which
      have a `data` part, with a `data.action` of `CREATE`, and a `data.data_object.type` of `RoundData`.

      Then, `data.data_object.timestamp` gives a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds, which captures a timestamp of when
      this transaction was committed to ledger. This timestamp is _not_ guaranteed to be increasing.

      Not every transaction will have such a `RoundData` operation, for example, due to multiple transactions being
      committed in the same consensus round, so the current timestamp should be kept track of as you iterate forward
      through the transactions on the ledger, until you see another new created `RoundData` operation,
      which replaces the timestamp.

        state_identifier:
          description: The state identifier point from which transactions should be returned.
            For example, if you specify a `state_version` of 10, the first transaction in the response
            will take the ledger from a `state_version` of 10 to 11, and so have a commited `state_version` of 11.
            The ledger starts from a `state_version` of 0, with the first transaction being the genesis transaction.
