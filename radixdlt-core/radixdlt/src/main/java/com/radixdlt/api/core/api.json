    "description": "This API provides endpoints for both RadixCore node management and support\nfor middleware integration (such as exchanges).\n\n# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Radix Core API Preview. This Preview API is intended for\nexchanges to be able to begin integrating with the Radix network. In particular,\nthe following endpoints will be frozen or at the very least backwards\ncompatible to version 1.0.0 of the Radix Core API:\n* `/network/configuration`\n* `/network/status`\n* `/transactions`\n* `/construction/build`\n* `/construction/parse`\n* `/construction/finalize`\n* `/construction/submit`\n\nAll other endpoints may change upon 1.0.0 release.\n\n:::warning\n\nThis API is NOT intended to be available on the public web and is designed\nto be used in private networks mainly for node management and integration.\nIn particular, endpoints in the Signing API if accessed by the public can\nresult in loss of funds.\n\n:::\n\n# Rosetta\n\nMuch of the design decisions of the Data API and Construction API endpoints is\ninspired from [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) most notably:\n  * Use of a JSON-Based RPC protocol on top of HTTP Post requests\n  * Use of Operations, Amounts, and Identifiers to express generic asset movement\n\nThere are a few notable exceptions to note:\n  * Fetching of ledger data is through a Transaction stream rather than a\n  Block stream\n  * Use of `EntityIdentifier` rather than `AccountIdentifier`\n  * Use of `OperationGroup` rather than `related_operations` to express related\n  operations\n  * Even though the Radix Ledger is UTXO based Construction endpoints does coin\n  selection on behalf of the caller. This has the unfortunate effect of not\n  being able to support high frequency transactions from a single account due to\n  UTXO spend conflicts. This will be addressed in future updates.\n  * Construction endpoints are mostly online rather than offline as required by\n  Rosetta\n\nFuture versions of the api will aim towards a fully-compliant Rosetta API.\n\n# Data API Sequence Flow\n\nClients can make use of the Data API endpoints in order to synchronize\neither a full or partial view (for example, only track XRD asset balances) of\nwhat's occuring on ledger transaction by transaction.\n\nSynchronization involves only using the Data API. Assuming the client has a\ndatabase which they are updating, below is a generic flow of operations on\nhow to synchronize via the Data API.\n\n![Data Sequence Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/data_sequence_flow.png)\n\n\n# Construction API Sequence Flow\n\nClients can make use of the Construction API endpoints to construct and submit\ntransactions to the network.\n\nThe following sequence flow allows for integrators to construct transactions\non behalf of clients or for their own use without ever holding the actual private\nkey.\n\n![Construction Sequence Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/feature/open-api/radixdlt-core/radixdlt/src/main/java/com/radixdlt/api/core/documentation/construction_sequence_flow.png)\n\nUnlike the Rosetta Construction API [specification](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html),\nthis Construction API selects the UTXOs on behalf of the caller. This has the unfortunate\nside effect of not being able to support high frequency transactions from a single\naccount due to UTXO conflicts. This will be addressed in a future release.\n",

Any state change which consists of two accounts (such as\na token transfer) thus requires atleast two Operations, one which debits\nthe sender and one which credits the receiver.\n\nUnlike Rosetta, operations are more explicitly linked via Operation Groups. Each\nOperation Group then represents a well formed accounting entry where credits\nand debits are equivalent (unless minting or burning occurred).\n\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/OperationGroup\" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />\n\n## Operation\n\nOperations operate on a single Entity and are associated with a single Amount\nupdate and/or a single Data update.\n\n* The `amount` property represents either a positive or negative change in balance of some token.\n* The `data` property represents either the creation or deletion of a data object.\n\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/Operation\" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />\n\n## Entity Identifier\n\nAn Entity Identifier uniquely describes an entity which may have arbitrary balances and arbitrary data\nobjects. An Entity Identifier may further specify a Sub Address which should be treated as a separate\nunique entity.\n\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/EntityIdentifier\" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />\n\n## Amount\n\nA signed amount of a resource.\n\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/ResourceAmount\" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />\n\n## Resource Identifier\n\nA Resource Identifier uniquely describes either some token or stake ownership of a validator.\n\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/ResourceIdentifier\" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />\n\n## Data Update\n\nA Data update is the creation or destruction of a data object.\n\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/Data\" showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />\n"

Subaddresses under\nan account-address contain assets which the account-address owns but is currently locked by the system.\n* **Validator**, an entity representing a validating node on the network.

Once XRD is in this entity, at some point the system will move this\nXRD to a Validator entity and mint StakeOwnership into the originating account.\n3. **Unstaking** may be started by transfering StakeOwnership from an account to a `prepared_unstake`\nentity. Once StakeOwnership is in this entity, at some point the system will destroy this\nStakeOwnership and transfer XRD from the Validator entity into your `exiting_stake` entity. Once\nthe unlocking period is over the system will move that XRD from the `exiting_stake` entity into your\naccount.\n4. **Validator Updates** may be started by destroying the current data object and creating a new\ndata object with the same type.\n5. **New Token Definitions** may be created by destroying an `UnclaimedREAddr` and creating a\n`TokenData` and `TokenMetadata` data object.\n"
