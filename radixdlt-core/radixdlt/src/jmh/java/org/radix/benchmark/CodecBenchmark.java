/**
 * Some JMH driven benchmarks for testing serialisation performance of
 * Radix and some third party libraries.
 * <p>
 * Note that the build system has been set up to make it easier to
 * run these performance tests under gradle.  Using gradle, it should
 * be possible to execute:
 * <pre>
 *    $ gradle clean jmh
 * </pre>
 * from the RadixCode/radixdlt directory.  Note that the JMH plugin
 * does not appear to be super robust, and changes to benchmark tests
 * and other code are not always re-instrumented correctly by gradle
 * daemons.  This can be worked around by stopping the daemons before
 * starting the tests using:
 * <pre>
 *    $ gradle --stop && gradle clean jmh
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, the configuration option {@code org.gradle.daemon=false}
 * can be added to the {@code ~/.gradle/gradle.properties} to completely
 * disable gradle daemons.
