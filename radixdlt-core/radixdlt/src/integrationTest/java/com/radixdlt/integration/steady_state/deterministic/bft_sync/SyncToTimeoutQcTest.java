/**
 * If quorum is formed on a timeout (timeout certificate), and there's a node that's a single view
 * behind (i.e. it didn't participate in forming of TC). Then it should be able to sync up (move to
 * next view) as soon as it receives a proposal (with a TC). BFTSync should then immediately switch
 * to next view without any additional sync requests. The setup is as follows: 1. there are 4 nodes
 * 2. proposal is sent by the leader (0) but only received by 2 nodes (including the leader): 0 and
 * 1 3. two nodes vote on a proposal (0 and 1) 4. two nodes vote on an empty timeout vertex and
 * broadcast the vote (2 and 3) 5. nodes 0 and 1 resend (broadcast) their vote with a timeout flag
 * 6. node 0 doesn't receive any of the above votes 7. nodes 1, 2 and 3 can form a valid TC out of
 * the votes they received, and they switch to the next view 8. next leader (node 1) sends out a
 * proposal 9. proposal (with a valid TC) is received by node 0 (which is still on previous view)
 * 10. node 0 is able to move to the next view just by processing the proposal's TC (no additional
 * sync requests) Expected result: node 0 is at view 2 and no sync requests have been sent
