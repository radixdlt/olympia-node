/**
 * When running a network with 3 nodes, where all proposals are dropped, leader should be able to
 * re-send his vote with a timeout flag and the vote should be accepted by all other nodes,
 * resulting in moving to a next view (once remaining two nodes also timeout). If the timeout
 * replacement votes are not accepted, then we loose a round because a node can only move to the
 * next view when it hasn't received the original non-timeout vote. This test checks that all nodes
 * only need a single timeout event to proceed to next view, even the node that initially received a
 * non-timeout vote (next leader), meaning that it must have successfully replaced a non-timeout
 * vote with a timeout vote in the same view.
